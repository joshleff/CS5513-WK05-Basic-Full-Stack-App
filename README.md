# Basic Full Stack App

This assignment iterates on the previous **Next.js** basic full stack app, introducing more complexity.
Witten in **Javascript**, it uses dynamic page routing to display data from two separate **JSON** files.
It includes styling from **Bootstrap**.  It also uses the **Jest** and **React** testing libraries to test that a component was rendered successfully.
